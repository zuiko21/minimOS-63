# minimOSÂ·63

*minimOS* port for the **Motorola 6800**/6802/6808 microprocessors,
6801/6803 microcontrollers and **Hitachi 6301/6303** microcontrollers. *Other microcontrollers
on this family (like **68HC05** and **68HC11**) are to be supported soon*.

Note that the **Motorola 6809** (and its *Hitachi* CMOS derivative) are NOT fully binary-compatible,
thus will use [their own specific port](https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS/tree/master/ports/09).
